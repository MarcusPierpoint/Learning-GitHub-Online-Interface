This is a story all about how my
life got flipped, turn upside down.
And I'd like to take a minute,
Just sit right there.
I'll tell you all bout how I
Became the Prince of  a town called Bel Air.

In West Philidelphia, born and raised,
On the playground is where I spent most of my days.

When a couple of guys, they were up to no good.
Starting making trouble in my neighbourhood.
I got in one little fight and my Mom got scared,
She said "You're off to live with your aunt and uncle in Bel Air".
